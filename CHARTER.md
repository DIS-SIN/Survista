## Project Charter

This project is intended to serve as an experiment in distruption and the potentials of a digital public service. These applications, no matter how polished they may look, are not being actively maintained by a formalized team. These projects are usually dreamt up, designed, built, tested, deployed, and verified by 1-2 curious and keen public servants.

## Project Goal(s)
* Automate the processing of survey data, integrate sentiment analysis, and automate keyword extraction for textual data
* Reduce the amount of time to go through large amounts of textual data from consulations and surveys 
* Objectify feedback given through surveys and consultations to better enable decision making
* Demonstrate the power of working in the open, leveraging the community and developer progress world wide to provide Canadians with an experience that meets the demands of a mobile and highly connected citizenry.
* Demonstrate to the world the Canadian Public Service is serious about digital transformation and is actively thinking and working on building the digital future
