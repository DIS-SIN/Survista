<h1> Survista the Automated NLP Survey Data API Framework </h1>
<p> Data is only useful if it's accessible. This framework written in python flask seeks to provide a pipeline for processing and creating an API for survey data regardless of survey tool used.
So long as you can export the data of your survey and place the data in the simple format, you will be able to creat an API easily and quickly. Survista has built in NLP which allows it to processes
sentiment score and magnitude for the whole survey, on a comment section, on the individual comment and even on the individual sentence scale! It also provides on the fly keyword unigrams
bigrams and trigrams keyword extraction for any number of comments you specify. Survista NLP are fully supported in English and French with additional language support coming soon. Survista currently relies
on the Google Natural Language API for sentiment Analysis and the Google Translate API for language detection on the sentence scale. However, additional support for a breadth of cognative services by
the different cloud vendor will be coming soon. Local options are also being evelauated</p>

<p> More Documentation coming soon, I'm writing this at two in the morning and realise I'm not going to be making much sense from this point forward </p>
