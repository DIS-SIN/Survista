# Survista
### The Survey Search Engine Powered by Python

[![Python](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg)](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/)

Survista is an automated API maker for your survey data with integrated NLP that is tool agnostic. It allows you to quickly get to the important stuff through the use of NLP as well as easily surface your data to any third party application through robust REST endpoints. The goal of survista is to enable analysts and field experts to quickly derive actionable insights without the cognative load of accessing data, cleaning data and manual textual processing

#### Upcoming Features!
Since survista has been presented at the February 2019 python meetup I have been fortunate to interact with many more knowledgable folks than me which has greatly assisted with the direction survista will take. Current planned upcoming features include:

- The ability to associate question answers to one another which will allow users to compare answers against the answers of another question 
- Processing of textual based questions rather than just comments
- Simple deployment and set up to allow the open source community to easily use and contribute
- User management and data access levels to be able to control and secure survey data
- Keyword based search to allow user to filter textual data based on keywords
- oAuth instead of basic auth for API and resources
- GraphQL enpoint

If you would like to see a feature please open a GitHub issue on the repo. I would love to hear from you
