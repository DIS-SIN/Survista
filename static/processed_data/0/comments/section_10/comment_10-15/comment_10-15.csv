10-15,en,After I registered for the event I received an email asking me to test my connection to confirm that when the event occurred I would be able to see everything. I tested and confirmed. That same email said I would receive a link to the WebEx event 24 hours before it was supposed to occur. I never received this email and when I attempted to access the event through other means there were no avenues available to connect me. A co-worker was attempting to register for the event and had issues. He sent numerous emails for support and he received no response from anyone. Very unfortunate.,-0.5,4.0,7,106
