0,Appreciated receiving test email the day before the event.  The test link worked.  Unfortunately the actual link for the event did not work.  So sadly I have missed the event.  Hoping that the presentation portion may be sent out at latter time for viewing when I have a moment.  I was really hoping to increase my knowledge of digital and how we as PS are moving forward in this space.
1,How do we become engaged with enabling digital services in the GC? By learning what the GC is doing to become a digital leader is a start. Attending and actively participating at sessions such as these help evolve our thinking by becoming more informed about the emerging needs of tomorrow. Simply thinking of possibilities and understanding limitations is a big step towards understanding the level of effort required in order to modernize GC services. It's not a paradigm shift. The need to reflect services that are modern and efficient has always existed. GC tends to be more static in nature because of the complexity of its organizational structure. Sessions such as these only scratches the surface of what we can do to enhance our knowledge of AI and its potential.
2,"No content, basic info, we could have found better speakers."
3,The event that was placed in my lessons in GcCampus did not contain the link for the WebEx. My supervisor and I all the sections of the event and we were unable to find it. Usually it's very straight forward and easy to join.
4,If possible I would like to have access to the Questions that were asked over Webcast/In House with Answers. Can these be sent to all attendees?
5,The webcast delivery was almost unwatchable due to frequently frozen video stream. I was expecting more information about actual procurement but the panel seemed mostly interested in discussing rather basic/introductory concepts about AI. The panels were otherwise very well-spoken and knowledgeable and I would have enjoyed listening regardless of how on topic they were with respect to procurement.
6,"I think this is still at the concept stage so wording it as ""what you need to know to use and procure AI"" is deceptive in that there is not enough evidence (other than a pilot) that the practices are sound and the most effective.   The folks in the audience did not get a chance to ask questions since the questions that came in through email were given priority."
7,"Yes, it was effective. I particularly liked Noel (one of the panelist) for providing simple and clear points delivered throughout his presentation: the general need of AI within the government and the growth of AI implications in the legal affairs as time will go by."
8,"Nous aurions aimé avoir du matériel pour chaque participant et pouvoir le rapporter au bureau pour le partager avec les collègues.
Il y avait de très bonnes questions sur Slido. J'aurais aimé qu'on prenne plus de temps pour y répondre.
Vous demandez si l'événement a rencontré les objectifs d'apprentissage. Il faudrait nous les rappeler pour pouvoir répondre à cette question."
9,Audio level on webcast was low and difficult to hear.
10,"The networking opportunities were excellent as well.  I met some great CSPS people with whom I'll be following up, and public servants from other departments who are going through similar challenges."
11,"The webcast was terrible. Frequent freezing, hearing multiple and different voices. No technical support. I suggest sending the video of the event to those who attend the webcast. Very interesting topic. Need more sessions on the subject."
12,Panel individuals spoke well and gave clear information - including answering the questions. Very well done by both moderator and panel.
13,The panel was very high-level and anyone who is already somewhat familiar with AI issues wouldn't have learned a lot.
14,"Certains documents ont été mentionnés, présentés ou distribués au gens sur place mais ceux comme moi en webdiffusion n'avions pas accès à ces documents. Il a été mentionné que ces documents seront accessibles éventuellement mais ils auraient dû l'être durant la webdiffusion."
15,After I registered for the event I received an email asking me to test my connection to confirm that when the event occurred I would be able to see everything. I tested and confirmed. That same email said I would receive a link to the WebEx event 24 hours before it was supposed to occur. I never received this email and when I attempted to access the event through other means there were no avenues available to connect me. A co-worker was attempting to register for the event and had issues. He sent numerous emails for support and he received no response from anyone. Very unfortunate.
16,I felt the session lacked a clear focus with tangible examples. It was difficult to see how AI will fit with my area of work. I found contextualizing the information to be difficult.
17,More sessions around this topic and other emerging technologies would be very helpful.
18,"The panel seemed to know little about what AI was and what it could do. They spoke in generalities about the ethics of AI and algorithmic impact assessments, but my impression was that they really didn't understand what that meant. At the end, I was certainly none the wiser.

And, I experienced technical issues. The video froze often but I was never able to connect with audio only."
19,This information should be more widely distributed.  I am now actively trying to think of uses for AI in my area.
20,Having a person who can speak to actual experience going through this process was perfect.
21,"Le titre n'était pas assez spécifique. Ce n'était pas une présentaiton sur l'utilisation de l'IA dans la fonction publique en générale, mais bien sur l'utilisation de l'IA pour créer un outil de procurement. J'aurais préféré une présentation plus générale ou un titre plus spécifique."
22,Did not participate (webinar)
23,"I was only able to stay for the Panel discussion.  While there was some relevant information discussed, it would have been extremely helpful to have had documents available in paper/on screen while discussing.  Many documents were alluded to but were not available, and no follow up email has yet been issued.  The panelists clearly possessed a significant amount of information, but I felt that they did not go into sufficient detail on their experiences."
24,
