16-1,en,"Change Management: I'd like to listen to a discussion on how the GC is building capacity (communities of practice, focus groups, working groups, learning opportunities, etc.). I'd like to understand the level of commitment from senior management in terms of engaging employees in digital enablement in the GC. For example, examining challenges and successes of talent development, training, leadership. Why aren't digital principles tied to our PMAs? Are there opportunities to encourage more flexible roles and responsibilities with respect to position criteria. Can we reform and modernize our current workforce structure? Are there policy barriers that prevent us from asking more commitment from our employees such as being digital (as a mindset) and thinking of modernization as a continuous cycle of evolution? Why aren't hiring practices more evolved? It would be extremely interesting to understand the investment needed to build our digital capacity along with challenges (perceived or real) such as impacts from union negotiations, collective agreements and our approach to hiring. I find having to constantly explain the benefits in making our data more accessible exhausting. Having to answer questions such as why modernizing our services is important and why enhancing our data state is meaningful. These suggestions are broad but I truly believe that examining the state of our workforce and thinking of how to build capacity (to fit the need of today and tomorrow) is important if we are going to be successful at becoming digitally relevant. The more we automate processes, the more important it is at examining its impact and consequences which require a human analysis.",0.20000000298023224,5.599999904632568,13,273
