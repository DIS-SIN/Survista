0,N/A  as I only signed up for the webinar
1,"I think the concept of identifying business requirements was really interesting but unfortunately I was not able to fully focus my attention because of differing views and needs of all participants. I attempted to focus attention on identifying one need for the purposes of completing the exercise but I wasn't very successful. I'm an introvert and without a moderator that can channel collective input, I'm not the best fitted. I will try to reach out to PSPC and see if I can conduct a mock exercise that is more focused because I believe there exists a mutual learning opportunity and that my input might help inform aspects of the procurement vehicle."
2,No idea I couldn't join
3,I would love to see the results from this workshop. I had to leave a few minutes early so didn't catch the wrap up!
4,I did not watch this through webcast.
5,We didn't have time to hear what other groups wrote.
6,C'était professionnel d'avoir 4-5 personnes qui faisaient le tour des tables.
7,It would have been nice to make provisions for those attending via webcast.
8,See my comments from the previous question.  It was effective to work with a colleague's real-life challenge and go through the process of scoping it.  It was a good combination with the panel discussion.
9,"I did not participate in the workshop. 
If there are materials from this workshop, I would like to have a copy. Please and thank you!"
10,Je n'ai malheureusement pas participé à l'atelier
11,"I like the structure of questionnaire (it seems to be easier to start from 13 then up to 1 statement of work). However, I am still a little confused. Who should fill the questionnaire? client-end user? contracting officers? both? This is a tool. To use the tool effectively, there should be a work organization to come with and a support structure (with real people) to help user of system to troubleshoot. Thanks."
12,The most relevant part was the presentation at the beginning of the workshop where the new procurement process was presented. The workshop itself wasn't super useful. We had to get into specifics on a topic that people around the table didn't know very well.
13,Accès en webdiffusion donc exclus de la partie atelier pratique.
14,I attended via WebEx. I did not attend the practical workshop.
15,I did not attend this part.
16,"Webcast participants could not participate in the in person activity re: building requirements. Hopefully further information to templates, guides etc.. will be sent out to webcast viewers on using the source list."
17,Did not attend.
18,Workshop was not part of the webcast
19,I found this workshop ok to interact with the people at my table. I would have liked to get feedback on our answers to know if we were on the right path or not.
20,Did not participate in this portion of the event
21,Unable to attend the workshop
